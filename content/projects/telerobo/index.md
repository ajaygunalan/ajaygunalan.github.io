My primary task was developing real-time audio, video, and point cloud (PCL) streams to VR when the user requested via ROS services. I used Multi-Threading in C++ to parallelly open several sensors using OpenCV and custom encoders to reduce latency. The software design is described in the slideShow below.

Then, I interfaced the gas sensor, temperature sensor, mic, and thermal camera with Nvidia Jetson and experimented with beam forming on the XMOS Microphone array using the ODAS library.
