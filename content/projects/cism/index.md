##### Abstract

we present a novel approach to implement compressive sensing in laser scanning microscopes (LSM), specifically in image scanningmicroscopy (ISM), using a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detector. Our method addresses two significant limitations in applying compressive sensing to LSM: the time to compute the sampling matrix and the quality of reconstructed images. We employ a fixed sampling strategy, skipping alternate rows and columns during data acquisition, which reduces the number of points scanned by a factor of four and eliminates the need to compute different sampling matrices. By exploiting the parallel images generated by the SPAD array, we improve the quality of the reconstructed compressive-ISM images compared to standard compressive confocal LSM images. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing higher-quality images with reduced data acquisition time and potential benefits in reducing photobleaching.
