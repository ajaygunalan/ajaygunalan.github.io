This study addresses the challenge of depth control in laser microsurgery under the separate optical path (SOP) category by using 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans to measure ablation depths, overcoming the limitations of traditional 1D and 2D scans. Compressive sensing was implemented directly on the OCT hardware, achieving a 69.11% reduction in scanning time by scanning only 25% of the sample with a reconstruction error of just 13.41%. A feedback controller based on depth maps precisely adjusted laser exposure time across various tissue types, maintaining an accuracy of 0.01 mm on ex-vivo chicken breast and pork samples — overcoming the limitations of previous feed-forward approaches that depended on tissue model accuracy.
