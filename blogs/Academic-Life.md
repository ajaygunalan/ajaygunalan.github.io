title: Some advice for new academics by Prof. Thrishantha Nanayakkara ICL, UK
summary: "Starting a new academic career involves negotiating for time and resources to focus on research and grant writing while building a strong team of PhD students and postdocs. It is essential to hire individuals who are self-motivated and adaptable to ensure the lab's success. Prioritize management training, collaborate selectively, and design courses that challenge students. Avoid academic politics, focus on impactful scientific contributions, and maintain a balance between research and teaching responsibilities."
