I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the [PULSE Lab](https://pulselab.jhu.edu/) at the Johns Hopkins University. I graduated with a Ph.D. in medical robotics at the [Italian Institute of Technology](https://iit.it/), where I focused on [[projects/Auto-CALM|surgical laser robots]] and [[projects/CISM|biomedical imaging]].

My previous experiences include working on [[projects/Tele-Robotics|tele-robotics]], [[projects/Legged-Robot|legged robotics]], [[projects/Humanoid-Asimov|humanoid]], and [[projects/Medical-Device|medical device]].

I love developing cutting-edge technology through the fusion of multiple disciplines. In this process, I enjoy working with a diverse team to solve new challenges.
